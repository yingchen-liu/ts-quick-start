# TypeScript Quick Start Project

This is a simple TypeScript starter project to quickly set up a development environment with testing, building tools, and code coverage integration. It uses Babel for transpiling, Jest for testing, and `ts-node` for running TypeScript directly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (for managing Node versions)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yingchen-liu/ts-quick-start.git
```

### 2. Setup the project

Run the setup script to prepare the environment for the project:

```bash
npm run setup
```

### 3. Run the project

To run the application, use:

```bash
npm start
```

This will use `ts-node` to run the `src/index.ts` file directly.

### 4. Run tests

To run the Jest tests, execute:

```bash
npm test
```

For code coverage, run:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

This will show a code coverage report after running the tests.


### 5. Build the project

To run tests and build the project, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
- Run Jest tests.
- Use Babel to transpile TypeScript files to JavaScript and output them in the `dist` directory.

```

## Scripts

- `setup`: Runs the setup script (`bash scripts/setup.sh`).
- `start`: Runs `src/index.ts` using `ts-node`.
- `test`: Runs Jest tests.
- `coverage`: Runs Jest tests with code coverage.
- `build`: Runs tests and then transpiles TypeScript code using Babel.

## Configuration Files

- **`.nvmrc`**: Specifies the Node.js version required for the project. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily switch to the correct version.
  
- **`babel.config.js`**: Configuration file for Babel, ensuring compatibility between TypeScript and JavaScript. It defines the presets and plugins used for transpiling.
  
- **`jest.config.js`**: Configuration file for Jest, which sets up the testing framework and code coverage options.

- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file that defines the compiler options, including module resolution and output directories.
